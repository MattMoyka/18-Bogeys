## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a good understanding of what i want my application to look like and what exactly I want it to do. I am also an avid golfer so I feel that I can deliver all the necessary info a golfer would want.

### Weaknesses:

There is a lot of posting and patching in the app and I am going to have to figure out how to connect it all. For example I have a form that is filled out submitted and then brings the user to another form thats going to add data to the first form.

### Opportunities:

This project will give me a great understanding of react and linking forms and storing data in a no code database. I will also use tailwind CSS for the styling on this project.

### Threats:

If I run into more errors than anticipated I will not be able to complete all the MVP features I want.
